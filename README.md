Unfinished Gameboy Emulator

This is my work on a GameBoy Emulator. It was never finished. The main technical difficulty I encountered was drawing to the screen in a reasonable amount of time

Other issues just came from the nature of the language being used. Fitting all these parts together in a non-restrciting OO way is hard.

Enough OpCodes should be implemented to execute everything in the BIOS
